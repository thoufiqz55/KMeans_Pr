#KMeans Clusterring project 
 Source of Data The San Francisco Controller's Office maintains a database of the salary and benefits

paid to City employees since fiscal year 2013. This data is summarized and presented on

the Employee Compensation and is also

available in CSV format in the directory.

Overview of the problem Description of Data : Each row is an employee, and has columns about employee's information like their job type,salary, hours of overtime,other benefits etc.Overall there are 22 column Do you need to reduce the number of columns? Is your data clean? What all parameters do we need to give to our clustering algorithm? How can we get these parameters? Does your data has some interesting insights? Objective of Problem : You have to fit the data to a clustering model.

Find the number of clusters for the data.

Try fitting the model to both the clustering algorithms you have learnt,K-Means and Hierarchical clustering.

Which one suits this data better?

Your model should help the State authorities/Policy makers to understand how they can improve on their policies for employee benefits
